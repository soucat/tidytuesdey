/* Character Mapping Table:
 * ILL: illegal character.
 * CTR: control character specific to the charset.
 * RET: carriage/return.
 * SYM: symbol (punctuation) that does not belong to word.
 * NUM: 0 - 9.
 *
 * Other characters are ordered by probabilities
 * (0 is the most common character in the language).
 *
 * Orders are generic to a language. So the codepoint with order X in
 * CHARSET1 maps to the same character as the codepoint with the same
 * order X in CHARSET2 for the same language.
 * As such, it is possible to get missing order. For instance the
 * ligature of 'o' and 'e' exists in ISO-8859-15 but not in ISO-8859-1
 * even though they are both used for French. Same for the euro sign.
