# Supporting new or Updating languages #

We generate statistical language data using Wikipedia as natural
language text resource.

Right now, we have automated scripts only to generate statistical data
for single-byte encodings. Multi-byte encodings usually requires more
in-depth knowledge of its specification.

## New single-byte encoding ##

Uchardet uses language data, and therefore rather than supporting a
charset, we in fact support a couple (language, charset). So for
instance if uchardet supports (French, ISO-8859-15), it should be able
to recognize French text encoded in ISO-8859-15, but may fail at
detecting ISO-8859-15 for non-supported languages.

This is why, though less flexible, it also makes uchardet much more
accurate than other detection system, as well as making it an efficient
language recognition system.
Since many single-byte charsets actually share the same layout (or very
similar ones), it
